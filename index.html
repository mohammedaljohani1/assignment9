        Mohammedal Johani is an amazing designer, and great to work with! I hired her to create a high-quality opt-in offer for my mailing list, and she quickly understood what I was looking for, and how to appeal to my somewhat complex market. She was efficient and supportive, asked great questions that helped me think through my offer, and brought great creativity and insight to the final product.

        I am totally happy with it, and have already gotten good feedback! She also has a great sense of humour! Thanks so much, Annie, it was really a pleasure!

// Continue to improve the season selector that we create for assignment 8. Feel free to change the topic from seasons to an interest of yours are we are going to include this as part of your portfolio for the final project. I gave some examples in the video but you would update the dropdown selector to give more information. One example would be to change the page to be about your favorite sports teams instead of the seasons. The selector would have options like baseball, football, basketball, etc and when a selector is chosen information about your favorite team for that sport would display. Example: Football is chosen so it would display a heading that says Pittsburgh Steelers, an image of their logo, change the background color to one of their colors and then show a summary paragraph about why you like them. 

// Your page should now include the following for each selection:

// Background Color
// Topic Title
// Topic Summary
// Photo

// Make sure to add styles to the page to make the image and text display properly on the page. Design is up to you. Make it look nice and clean.


function seasonSelector(selectElem) {
  var i = selectElem.selectedIndex;
  if (i < 0) {
   
    return;
  }

  var optionValue = selectElem.options[i].value;

 
  if (optionValue === "test1") {

    document.getElementById('test1').style.display = 'block';
    document.getElementById('test2').style.display = 'none';
